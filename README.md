# 🔢 Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver - AI  

This project solves **Cryptarithmetic puzzles** using a **brute-force approach with permutations**. Given a puzzle like `"SEND + MORE = MONEY"`, the program finds a valid digit substitution where each letter represents a unique digit (0-9). The solution is displayed in an **interactive HTML page** with a beautifully formatted table and solved equation.

## 🏗️ How It Works  

1️⃣ **User inputs a cryptarithmetic equation** (e.g., `SEND + MORE = MONEY`). ✍️  
2️⃣ The **program finds a valid digit substitution** for each letter using permutations. 🔢  
3️⃣ The **sum of words is checked** to match the given result. ✅  
4️⃣ The **solution is saved as an HTML file** for easy visualization. 🗂️  
5️⃣ Open the generated **HTML file in a browser** to view the solved equation and letter mapping. 🌍
